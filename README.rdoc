jireport is console app in ruby 1.9

It is designed to create custom reports of issue resolve activity in JIRA.

Three scripts available:

1. bin/fetch

  Fetches issues state and tracks it to database,
  allowing to add additional data based on comparison with already
  stored one. Database is accessed via ActiveRecord (from Rails 3.0).

2. bin/report

  Generates report based on stored data,
  for now, using Google Spreadsheet API.

3. bin/report_cur_week

  Generates report for current week.
